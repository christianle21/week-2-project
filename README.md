# My Portfolio (Homework For Week 2)

Worked with my blood, sweat, and tears to make this portfolio (V1). Through sickness and health, this is what I produced but it's only the start. Nonetheless, I believe it's valiant effort and it can only look better from here on out. Enjoy what it looks like now and I hope you monitor the progress of the website/portfolio because it will continute to look better and be improved on.
